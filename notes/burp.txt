# Methodology

# Scope
Firefox > surf to the target site and click on a couple of links.
Burp > Target > Site map > right click (RC) on the target URL > Add to scope
Target > Scope: you will see the URL listed in the top window
Target > Site map > Filter: enable Show only in-scope items > Filter

# Manually browse the app
Look for target.com/sitemap.
If present, hold down the Command key and click on about 20 links.
If not present, start exploring the target by clicking on every link on every page.
Enter a single tick (') in any input field.
Continue until you have thoroughly browsed the target.

# Spider the app
Target > Site map > RC on the target URL > Spider this host
Spider > Control: watch the Requests made increase.
When the Requests and Forms queued are both zero, click Spider is running.

Target > Site map > RC the target URL > Expand branch
Scroll to the very bottom.
RC on any folders that are greyed out > Delete branch
RC on any pages that are grey or red > Copy URL > paste into Firefox
     Or RC on any pages that are grey or red > GET Empty Response
Save the state: <appname>-spider

# Brute force directories
Target > Site map > RC on the second line '/' > Send to Intruder
Intruder > Position > Attack type: Sniper
Clear §
On the top line, select the forward slash '/' after GET > Add §
Move the forward slash in front of the two symbols. It should look like: GET /§§

Payloads:
     Payload Sets
          Payload set: 1
          Payload type: runtime file
     Payload Options:
          Select file > seclists > Discovery > Web_Content > raft-medium-directories.txt > Open
     Start attack

Clean up results when the attack completes:
     Filter > uncheck 4xx [request error] > Filter
     Click Status to sort by ascending.
     Select the first line with a 302 status.
     Hold down shift and select the last line with a 302 status.
     RC > Delete select items > Yes

Add remaining items to Site map:
     Select the first line and RC in the bottom pane > Request in browser > In current browser session
     Check: In future, just copy the URL and don't show this dialog > Copy
     Firefox > open a new tab > paste
     Repeat with the remaining lines.

# Grey folders
RC on grey folder > GET Empty Response
If the folder is still grey > RC > Delete branch > Yes

# Review comments
Target > Site map > RC the target URL > Engagement tools > Find comments
Sort by Item
Review each line item for sensitive information.
---------------------------------------------------------------

# Brute force logins
Try to login
Proxy > History > find the POST request > RC > Send to Intruder

Intruder > Payloads > Attack type:
     Sniper:
          Uses a single set of payloads against a single variable.
     Battering ram:
          Uses a single set of payloads against all variables.
     Pitchfork:
          Uses multiple payload sets.
          For example: you have a known list of usernames and a related list of passwords. 
          This will try the first username with the first password, then the second username with the second password, and so on.
          This is useful when checking for old accounts that should be deleted.
     Cluster bomb:
          Uses multiple payload sets.
          For example: you have a known list of usernames and a non-related list of passwords.
          This will try the first username with each password, then the second username with each password, and so on.

-- Brute force basic authentication: Sniper
     Clear $
     Highlight the Authorization: Basic parameter > Add $
     This parameter is Base64 encoded.
     Copy the parameter > Decoder > paste in the top window
     Select the top drop-down menu on the right > Base64
     For example: YWRtaW46dGVzdDEyMw== decoded is admin:test123
     Notice there is a colon between the username and password
     
     Intruder > Payloads > Payload Sets > Payload type: Custom iterator
     List 1 with the possible Usernames and List 2 with possible passwords.
     Position: 1
          Type in the username (admin in our example) > Add
          Separator for position 1: : (colon in our example)
     Position: 2
          Load > choose your wordlist > Open
     Now we need to encode the whole string into Base64.
     <*** more stuff here ***>
     Start attack
     
-- Brute force a password: Sniper
     Clear $
     Highlight the password you entered > Add $
     Intruder > Payloads > Payload Options
     Load > choose your password list > Open
     Start attack

-- Brute force usernames and passwords: Cluster bomb
     Clear $
     Highlight the username you entered > Add $ 
     Highlight the password you entered > Add $
     Intruder > Payloads
          Payload Sets
               Payload set: 1
               Payload type: Simple list
          Payload Options
               Clear > Load: choose your username list > Open
          Payload Sets
               Payload set: 2
               Payload type: Simple list
          Payload Options
               Clear > Load: choose your password list > Open
          Start attack

Filter > uncheck 4xx [request error] > Filter
Click Status to sort by ascending.
Look for a 302 (redirect). This should be a successful login.

# Actively scan the app

# CSRF

You should be logged into the web application.
Create a list of all POST requests that do not have a unique token called ‘CSRF_Token’. 

Proxy > HTTP history > Filter > Filter by search term
     ^POST((?!CSRF_Token).)*$
     Click Regex

RC on the first request > Engagement tools > Generate CSRF PoC
Test in browser > Copy
Open a new tab in Firefox > paste

Look for evidence that it executed whatever that HTTP request was supposed to do.
