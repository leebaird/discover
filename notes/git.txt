Working on a topic branch

Always try to avoid working on the master branch. It usually results in merge conflicts and/or update issues. Instead, work on a bug/feature/topic branch whenever possible.

   #start from the master branch
   git checkout master

   #create a new branch
   git branch dev/kraman/bug/12345

   #switch to the new branch
   git checkout dev/kraman/bug/12345

   #...make changes...

Staying updated

Once a fork has been created, it does not automatically track the upstream repository. Follow the steps outlined below to keep the master branch up-to-date.

   #pull the latest changes from upstream
   git fetch upstream
   git fetch upstream --tags

   #make sure there are no un-committed changes
   git stash

   #make sure we are working on the master branch
   git checkout master

   #merge the latest changes
   git merge upstream/master

   #push the updates changes to our GitHub fork
   git push origin master
   git push origin --tags

   #return to your bug/feature branch
   git checkout dev/kraman/bug/12345

   #rebase this branch onto latest code from master (expect conflicts)
   git rebase master

   #... resolve conflicts

   #push the rebased branch back to your fork
   git push origin dev/kraman/bug/12345 -f

   #Restore any un-committed changes
   git stash pop

NOTE: The git stash steps are optional. It is easier if you commit all changes before attempting a rebase.


Submitting a patch

Once your code is ready to be submitted, you will need to submit a pull request with your changes.

    Update your branch and make sure you are rebased off the latest upstream/master
    Squash your commits onto a single revision
    Submit a pull request on GitHub 

Squashing your changes into one revision

Before you can submit a request, rebase all your changes on to a single commit. This makes it easier to review and also makes reverting the code easier in case of any build breakages.

   git rebase -i master
   #... squash commits ...

# Deleting local and remote branches

	#local
	git branch -D <branchname>

	#remote
	git push origin --delete <branchname>

# Creating a branch and checkout at the same time

    To create a branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the git checkout command with the -b switch:

     git checkout -b iss53
    Switched to a new branch 'iss53'
