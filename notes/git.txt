-- Cloning your fork

Clone the repository from your fork.

     git clone git@github.com:<username>/<repo-name>.git
     git clone git@github.com:kraman/crankcase.git

Add the upstream repo so that you can pull changes.

     git remote add upstream <original repo git url>
     git remote add upstream git@github.com:openshift/crankcase.git

Stop Errors pushing changes.

     # Point this command to your fork of the repository.
     git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<username>/<repo-name>.git


-- Working on a topic branch.

Always try to avoid working on the master branch. It usually results in merge conflicts 
and/or update issues. Instead, work on a bug/feature/topic branch whenever possible.

     # Start from the master branch.
     git checkout master

     # Create a new branch.
     git branch dev/kraman/bug/12345

     # Switch to the new branch.
     git checkout dev/kraman/bug/12345

     # Make changes.


-- Staying updated

Once a fork has been created, it does not automatically track the upstream repository. 
Follow the steps outlined below to keep the master branch up-to-date.

     # Pull the latest changes from upstream.
     git fetch upstream
     git fetch upstream --tags

     # Make sure there are no un-committed changes.
     git stash

     # Make sure you are working on the master branch.
     git checkout master

     # Merge the latest changes.
     git merge upstream/master

     # Push the updates changes to our GitHub fork.
     git push origin master
     git push origin --tags

     # Return to your bug/feature branch.
     git checkout dev/kraman/bug/12345

     # Rebase this branch onto latest code from master (expect conflicts).
     git rebase master

     # Resolve conflicts.

     # Push the rebased branch back to your fork.
     git push origin dev/kraman/bug/12345 -f

     # Restore any un-committed changes.
     git stash pop

NOTE: The git stash steps are optional. It is easier if you commit all changes before
attempting a rebase.


-- Submitting a patch

Once your code is ready to be submitted, you will need to submit a pull request with 
your changes.

     Update your branch and make sure you are rebased off the latest upstream/master.
     Squash your commits onto a single revision.
     Submit a pull request on GitHub.


-- Squashing your changes into one revision.

Before you can submit a pull request, rebase all your changes onto a single commit.
This makes it easier to review, and also makes reverting the code easier in case of 
any build breakages.

     git rebase -i master
     #... squash commits ...


-- Deleting local and remote branches.

     # Local
     git branch -D <branchname>

     # Remote
     git push origin --delete <branchname>


-- Creating a branch and checkout at the same time.

To create a branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the git checkout 
command with the -b switch.

     git checkout -b iss53
     Switched to a new branch 'iss53'


-- Testing pull requests locally.

    # Make sure you are on the master branch of your fork.
    git fetch upstream pull/ID/head:BRANCHNAME

    # Change to branch that you want to test.
    git checkout BRANCHNAME
